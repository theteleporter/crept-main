    "description": "Tashi, a tennis player-turned-coach, has transformed her husband from a mediocre player into a world-famous grand slam champion. To jolt him out of his recent losing streak, she makes him play a challenger event - close to thelowest level of tournament on the pro tour - where he finds himself standing across the net from the once-promising, now burnt-out Patrick: his former best friend and Tashi's former boyfriend.",
